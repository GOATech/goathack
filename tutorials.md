### P2P Tech

The following are some very promising projects in the realm of 'peer to peer' networking / filesharing / archiving / mapping technologies.  Several folks in GOAT have seen potential applications to data sharing and communications in research and in farming contexts - especially in conditions of intermittent connectivity, or to avoid commercial lock-in with proprietary  vendors (e.g. DropBox or Google). 
* [Dat Project](https://datproject.org/) -- peer to peer filesharing -- opensource 'Dropbox' alternative
* [Cabal](https://cabal-club.github.io/) -- experimental p2p chat
* [Kappa Workshop](https://kappa-db.github.io/workshop/build/01.html) -- quick tutorial for folks to get started developing with  p2p datasharing
* [Mapeo](https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/) -- off-grid, p2p mapping used with indigenous communities (applications to rural farming!)
* [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) -- p2p browser tech
