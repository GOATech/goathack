# Projects for GOAT:Hack @ USDA ARS 2019

## Vision: The Reconfigurable Open-Ag Research Pipeline
The reconfigureable research pipeline is comprised of open source, community created information technologies and processes that support sustainable agriculture research. The pipeline is comprised of technologies and processes that support the design of research objectives, the acquisition, processing, and storage of data for research findings, and visualization of research findings for dissemnination.

Each technology and process in the reconfigurable open-ag research pipeline serves a unique and focused purpose to one or several parts of the research data pipeline (e.g., data visualization). With a multiplicity of research pipeline technologies and processes in the Reconfigurable Open-Ag Research Pipeline, an open-ag researcher is able to select the technologies and processes that support their project-specific research objectives.

The goal of GOAT:Hack @ USDA ARS is to begin building the Reconfigurable Open-Ag Research Pipeline. Each project will contribute ideas, concept models, prototypes, and proofs of concepts that further the development of this pipeline.

## Projects
# Plant Data Service
* Project Team: Ankita (facilitator), Juliet, Victoria
* Overview: [2-3 sentence context of the problem]
* Challenge Questions: [Write up in the form of 1-3 questions or problem statements.]
* Datasets: [Describe your dataset, including a brief data dictionary. Also list any external datasets you’d like, be as specific as possible (e.g., climate variables)]
* Software Stack: [what would you use/need]
* Description of Deliverables: [provide a brief description (or even a screenshot or link) to any visual outputs you have created, OR provide a description of outputs you would like to create e.g., graphs, models, visualizations, connections to other things.]
* References: [include any ancillary documentation (references, diagrams, background) you think would be useful.] 
* Project repositories: [url]
* Project website: [url]
